Flee code is suboptimal.
- Miners don't actually optimally flee, i.e they don't choose the square that's attacked the least.

Launcher Code is suboptimal
- Launchers kind of get stuck in a certain spot, could be addressed if we went
in the direction of the last enemy as opposed to just where the last enemy was.
- Should go to broadcasts; of either amplifiers or carriers.

Also, we have no idea how to deal with clouds.
- Soldiers should hide in them when low health?
