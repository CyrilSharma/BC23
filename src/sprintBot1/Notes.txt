Flee code is suboptimal.
- Miners sometimes return to where they just fleed from [bug].
- Miners sometimes don't attack even when they're clearly going to die.
- Miners don't actually optimally flee, i.e they don't choose the square that's attacked the least.

Mining Code is suboptimal
- Prioritizing mana in the short run is suboptimal on larger maps it seems.

Launcher Code is suboptimal
- Launchers sometimes can cascade whole groups of themselves in random dircetions.
- This could be potentially addressed if we account for launcher health.
- Launchers kind of get stuck in a certain spot, could be addressed if we went
in the direction of the last enemy as opposed to just where the last enemy was.
- Should go to broadcasts; of either amplifiers or carriers.

Carrier Code is ok this is kind of redundant
- They should broadcast locations of enemies.

Also, we need to build amplifiers late game!
